\section{Abstract}

\paragraph{}
In this report, first the problem of estimating the relative state of a missile intercept will be introduced, with main objective as minimizing the miss distance. The problem is solved by designing a \textit{Continuous-Time Kalman Filter} and through implementation in MATLAB environment. This is followed by running a Monte Carlo simulation to show the actual error variance matches the \textit{a priori} error variance used in computing Kalman filter gain. Finally, the Gauss-Markov process is replaced with a random telegraph signal to ensure that the Kalman filter is implemented correctly by running, again, a Monte Carlo analysis.
