Fall 2016

I think I started thinking about what I want to learn, and what kind of results I want to have when I graduate as a PhD. And I started taking some tough classes around that period. 236A is one of the first. Back then I was very uncomfortable with row/column of a matrix and have to look up a dictionary to figure out which one is which. It has been a year and half. How time flies.
