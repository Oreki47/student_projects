# Machine Learning from Coursera

On 02/15/2018:

I think I took the class somewhere between Winter 2016 to Spring 2016. All I did was coding some .m, which from my point of view today, is not actually learning. Given a homework framework and try to fill in several lines of code without worrying about other things does not really help one out. That being said, this is still a good starting point. But I would say the notes on CS 229 is definitely more helpful.
