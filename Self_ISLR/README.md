# An-Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning
Notes/Codes for ISLR Around 09/2017

I want to start things as organized as possible but it does not usually end with what I want.
I started the book hoping I could go over everything in the book, including all the practice problems.

I managed to finish everything for the first 6 chapters but now I have other things with higher priority.
So what I did was to quickly go over the rest of the book. Yes, I finished the whole book (proud of myself :p).
This is the first machine learning book I have even finished and it is a good start.

I have also pulled up a short notes in latex, with a great amount of contents just copying stuff in the book
that I think is important. It is mainly used for a short recap for myself. 

Time to move on and explore the new world :p

Update 02/15/2018

I do not think I would be able to finish the coding part. But again and again I come back to it and find this book useful. Now I have better ideas of how to use this kind of books. My preference is to read it through swiftly to get a first impression. Then whenever I encounter something in the real world, come back to get a deeper understanding.
