\subsubsection*{(a)}
Figure 5 presents the degree distribution of an instance of preferential attachment model with preferential attachment exponent $pa.exp = 1$, and aging parameter $aging.exp = -1$.

\subsubsection*{(b)}
Using fast greedy method for clustering over 100 instances, we find average modularity of the entire graph $ mod_{aver} = 0.935$ and average cluster size $l_{aver} = 33.00$.
