\subsection*{Problem 3}
\subsubsection*{(a)}
\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:c1} shows the frequency of each degree being picked. We correlated frequency of 100 nodes with their degree and $cor = 0.9011$.

	\label{fig:c2}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{(b)}
\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:c2} shows the frequency of each degree being picked. Again this is similar to (a) and $cor=0.8300$.
\subsubsection*{(c)}
\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:c3} shows the frequency of each degree being picked. With a random jump the correlation is somewhat a bit lower than $cor=0.8956$.
