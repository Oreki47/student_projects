# student_projects

---------------------------
On 02/15/2018.

This is a repo for my own records that tracks all of the projects I have finished as a student in the period of 2014-Present at UCLA for my PhD degree. I understand that most PhDs do not take a lot of classes. But I want to take a different approach. I am aiming 1 class each quarter so as to keep up the feeling of being a student. Partly this is a nostalgia thing as I have only roughly 2 more years to go as a student. It is unlikely that I will pursue another degree. But mostly it is about learning, learning different things from people with different background that otherwise I would unlikely encounter.

This repo also includes most of the notes/code (items marked self_. Now that I think about it, I should use book_ as prefix) as I read through some useful/unnecessary books.

I will continue update this repo as my life goes on.
