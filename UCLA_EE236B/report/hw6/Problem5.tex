\subsection*{T5.21}
\subsubsection*{(a)}
This is a convex problem since the objective function is a convex function and the constraint is also convex. The optimal value $p^{\star} = 1$ and $x^{\star} =0$, $y^{\star} \in R_+$.
\subsubsection*{(b)}
The dual can be written as 
\begin{align*}
&maximize \qquad 0\\
&subject\ to \qquad \lambda \geq 0
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
Therefore $d^{\star} =0$. The duality gap $p^{\star}-d^{\star} =1$.
\subsubsection*{(c)}
\paragraph{}
The Slater's condition does not hold in this case.
