\section*{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
In this report, we present analysis of network structure of a combined Facebook network and 100+ separate Google Plus networks. We conclude that \textit{Walktrap} tend to be the algorithm to deal with partitioning communities in social network, as it tend to have more smaller clusters. For Gplus network, we discovered that \textit{Infomap} tend to be the better choice over \textit{Walktrap} to discover overlaps between communities and circles. The property of \textit{Walktrap} discussed above becomes a weak point as the communities are too scattered apart. All in all, we gained a deep understanding for what kind of tools we need for specific tasks. And on the high level idea, we also learnt that for different task of analysis we need to select tools selectively.
