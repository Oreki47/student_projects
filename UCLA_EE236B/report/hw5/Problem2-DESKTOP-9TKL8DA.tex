\paragraph{}
For rule 2 we have
\begin{align*}
\log f =\log (\max\{g_1, g_2,...,g_m\}) = \max\{\log g_1, \log g_2\,...,\log g_m\}
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
This is followed by logarithm function being monotonically increasing over $R_{++}$, which is the domain of $f(x)$. since $\log g_i, i=1,...,m$ are convex, $\log f$ is also convex since it is the supreme of a family of convex functions.
