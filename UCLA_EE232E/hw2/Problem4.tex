\subsection*{Problem 4}
\subsubsection*{(a)}
\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:d1} presents the case of directed graph with teleportation, with a $cor = 0.8178$.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{(b)}
\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:d2} presents the case of directed graph with teleportation, with a $cor = 0.8211$. Ideally the correlation score should be a bit higher than case (a) since now teleportation also follows degree distribution. Here we see a slight increase in such score. However with one realization of the random graph this is not guaranteed.

\subsubsection*{(c)}
\paragraph{}
With $\alpha$ introduced as the probability of teleportation, the formula is as follows.
\begin{align*}
	\pi(i)=(1-\alpha)\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{1}{deg_o(\nu_j)}A_{ji}\pi(j) + \frac{\alpha}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\pi(j)
\end{align*}
