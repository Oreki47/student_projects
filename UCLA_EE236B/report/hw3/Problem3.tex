\begin{align*}
	f(x)=-\log(u(v-\frac{x^Tx}{u})) = -\log u - \log(v-\frac{x^Tx}{u})
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
From composition rule, with $v-\frac{x^Tx}{u}$ being concave and $-\log x$ concave and nondecreasing, $-\log(v-\frac{x^Tx}{u})$ is concave. Also $-\log u $ is concave and therefore $f(x)$ is the sum of two concave function and therefore is also concave.
