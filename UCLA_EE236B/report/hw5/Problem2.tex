\paragraph{}
For rule 2 we have
\begin{align*}
\log f =\log (\max\{g_1, g_2,...,g_m\}) = \max\{\log g_1, \log g_2\,...,\log g_m\}
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
This is followed by logarithm function being monotonically increasing over $R_{++}$, which is the domain of $f(x)$. since $\log g_i, i=1,...,m$ are convex, $\log f$ is also convex since it is the supreme of a family of convex functions.
\paragraph{}
For rule 3 we have $h(g(1),...,g_m(x))$ convex since $\log g_k(e^{y_1},...,e^{y_n})$ is convex, and log-convex functions are closed under multiplication and addition. It is nondecreasing since it is a monotone posynomial. $g$ is also convex since it could be written as $g(e^y) = \sum_{i =1}^{K} c_i\exp^{a_i^Ty}$, which is a composition of sum over a family of exponential composited with affine functions $a_i^Ty$. From here we apply the composition rule and conclude that $\log f $ is convex.
