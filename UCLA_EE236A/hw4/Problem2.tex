\subsection*{Problem 2}
\paragraph{}
The given system could be reformed as follow:
\begin{align*}
& (P - I)y = 0 \\
& \textbf{1}^T y = 1 \\
& y \leq 0
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
From Farkas's Lemma, to prove the above system to be feasible, we can prove the following alternative system to be infeasible, i.e., there exist no $z \in R^n,\ \omega \in R$ such that satisfy:
\begin{align*}
& (P - I)z + \textbf{1}\omega = 0 \\
& \omega < 0 
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
Combine the two and we have
\begin{align*}
& (P - I)z > 0
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
or,
\begin{align}
& Pz > z
\end{align}
\paragraph{}
This is impossible due to the fact that $p_{ij}$ is positive and columns of $P$ sum to one and we should have
\begin{align*}
& (Pz)_i \leq \max\{z_j\}, \qquad i,j =1,...,n
\end{align*}
\paragraph{}
Which contradicts to (1), and therefore we can prove that the original system is feasible.
