# UCLA MAE 271B Stochastic Processes in Dynamical Systems

Winter 2017.

I think by that time I am more confortable with a lot of things. To start with, the project, somewhat similar to the one I did in 271A, took me only like 2 days and the results look bug free. Beware I did not say my code is bug free. There is always bugs. It is just a matter if you capture it.

Still I remember I was a bit uncomfortable with Python, as I remember going through some source code in python, and it was a lot of pain. Things are a bit different now, aren't they.
