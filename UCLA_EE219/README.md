# UCLA ECE 219 Winter 2018

On 02/15/2018

This is an on-going lecture, so I will gradually add more in as we pass more deadlines. Currently there are 2 projects. First one finished by Xin Jiang (Not sure if he has github) and second one finished by me. One obvious thing is that I have completed shifted to Python and is feeling comfortable (which also means that I need to learn something new) with general data manipulation and more.
